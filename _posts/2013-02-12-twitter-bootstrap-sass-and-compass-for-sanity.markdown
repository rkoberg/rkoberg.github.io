<p>Twitter Bootstrap: <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</a><br />
Sass: <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" title="style with attitude">http://sass-lang.com/</a><br />
Compass: <a href="http://compass-style.org/" title="Compass is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework.">http://compass-style.org/</a></p>
<p>I have used this combination on several web sites and really like it. I understand there is <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" title="The most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world.">Foundation</a>, but prefer bootstrap and honestly probably just more used to it. </p>
<p>I understand that bootstrap uses <a href="http://lesscss.org/" title="The dynamic stylesheet language.">less</a> out of the box, but find sass much more appealing. With compass, you can edit the source files and get them generated to CSS on the fly.</p>
<p>I just started this Wordpress blog over the weekend and brand new to Wordpress in general. I thought the best way to start to understand it was creating a custom theme. The first thing I did was setup an environment where I could use bootstrap, sass, and compass. After a few failed attempts with top google results, I went with <a href="http://forge.thethemefoundry.com/" title="a free command-line toolkit for bootstrapping and developing WordPress themes">forge</a> to generate a theme and have my CSS and JavaScript generated on the fly. I have the ruby gem <a href="https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass" title="bootstrap-sass is bootstrap for Sass, ready to roll">bootstrap-sass</a> installed from other projects, so that is what I will use for the CSS part.</p>
<p>Rails comes with this ability built-in with a few extra gems. Even for a simple web site, a drupal based one, or some even more complex monstrosity, these three support my sanity. </p>
